## Preface

CULLinary2 is a student game project from the module CS4350: Game Development Project @ National University of Singapore (NUS). I took this module in AY21/22 Semester 1 under Prof Anand Bhojan. It is the follow-up game to the previous semester's showcase-winning CULLinary.

This page features some of my team's (Team Angry Eggplant) notes from my perspective (when I am free enough to write). Feel free to read or play the game via the _Games_ page

_Note that the game can only be played on modern browsers on your desktop such as Chrome/Safari/Firefox._

_The game on the browser is also not tested due to the laziness of this happy but exhausted developer and you may experience unexpected crashes. I recommend you to download the original executable from our GitHub releases/itch.io website instead if you wish to have a crash-free experience!_

_Note that Chaos Mode (where the map is randomnized) is not available on the browser version of the game. In its place are the easy (endemic) and hard (pandemic) modes._

[Or download the game from here](https://github.com/AngryEggplantStudios/CULLinary2/releases/tag/v1.0)

[Or from the itch.io website](https://angryeggplant.itch.io/cullinary-2)

[Or watch our trailer first!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_uVAnabw4Q)

We also entered the 19th iSTePS showcase in which we clinched 1st place out of 5 teams. :) This game is a step-up in terms of difficulty from the first game but also a step-up in terms of fun!

Enjoy and have fun!

## Game Description

üçÜüåΩü•î CULLinary 2 is a crossover game between a Dungeon Crawler and a Food Delivery Simulator where you cook and deliver what you cull! üçñüçÖüßÄ

Welcome to the zesty world of CULLinary 2, where you play as Chef, an aspiring restaurant owner trying to spread joy to the world, one dish at a time. With the onset of the Clownavirus pandemic, Chef has no choice but to close down his restaurant and deliver food to his customers instead.

Experience the tangy thrill of battling against the clock by making sure your hungry customers get their food on time as you traverse the vibrant open-world of CULLinary 2 and hunt for the ingredients you need to cook up a storm, using a variety of full-bodied weapons, fiery skills, and earthy power-ups.

Inventory management? Time crunch? Fetch quests? CULLinary 2 has them all.

## Technical Details

Same as the first game, we used Unity 2020.3.8f1 and a lot of C# madness for this game. Our animator and designer in chief (and his team) also used Blender for some of the modeling and animations :) Unlike the first game, the monsters in this game are all 'created'/'modified' from scratch (some based on existing free assets), including their animations.

## Personal Contributions

My personal contributions include getting the save system and database up, player locomotion and attacks (primary and secondary), shop & upgrade system, as well as some of the menu features like the inventory and creature dex.

## Useful Links

The game can either be played on the browser or via an executable (Available on Windows, MacOS) which can be downloaded from the Releases on our GitHub repository/Itch.io page.
