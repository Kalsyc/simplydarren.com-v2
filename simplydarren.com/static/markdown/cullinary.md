## Preface

CULLinary is a student game project from the module CS3247: Game Development @ National University of Singapore (NUS). I took this module in AY20/21 Semester 2 under Prof Anand Bhojan. This page features some of my team's (Team Angry Eggplant) notes from my perspective (when I am free enough to write). Feel free to read or...

[Play the game right away here on your browser](https://www.simplydarren.com/projects/cull1)

_Note that the game can only be played on modern browsers on your desktop such as Chrome/Safari/Firefox._

_The game on the browser is also not tested due to the laziness of this happy but exhausted developer and you may experience unexpected crashes. I recommend you to download the original executable from our GitHub releases instead if you wish to have a crash-free experience!_

[Or download the game from here](https://github.com/AngryEggplantStudios/CULLinary/releases/tag/v1.4)

[Or watch our trailer first!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKpQ_maMmHE)

We also entered the 18th iSTePS showcase in which we clinched 1st place out of 8 teams. :) Not gonna lie but the game is actually quite fun and it'll be your introduction to the series (which will later be followed by the more complete and dynamic second game, CULLinary2).

Have fun!

## Game Description

CULLinary is a crossover game between a Dungeon Crawler and a Restaurant Management Simulator where you cook what you cull!

You are an owner of a humble restaurant in your hometown. Recently, chemical waste from the nearby factories have caused the flora and fauna to mutate into monsters.

As a result, the number of visitors to the town is declining rapidly, running your restaurant out of business. Now your job is to kill off the monsters, grow your restaurant so that you can attract visitors back to your town and make it great again!

## Technical Details

We used Unity 2020.2.3f1 and a lot of C# madness for this game. Our animator and designer in chief also used Blender for some of the modeling and animations :)

## Personal Contributions

My personal contributions include writing part of the map generation, getting the save system and database up, player locomotion and attacks, as well as the shop system.

## Useful Links

The game can either be played on the browser or via an executable (Available on Windows, MacOS and Linux) which can be downloaded from the Releases on our GitHub repository. Instructions to download are in the repository's README.
